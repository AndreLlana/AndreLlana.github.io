Hey there, Fashion Challenge folks! Today


2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.760
we're going to tackle the ancient and


3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.320
mystifying art of tie-tying. Don't worry,


4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.200
I promise you won't end up looking like a


5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.440
tangled spaghetti monster.


6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.961
I call it the Necktie Ninja.


7
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.721
Hold your tie on one hand like a pro


8
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.401
ninja warrior and drape it around your


9
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.721
neck. Make sure one end is a bit longer


10
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.641
than the other, unless you want to start


11
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.041
a new fashion trend: the uneven tie.


12
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.841
Now here comes the loop de loop. Take the


13
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.761
longer end and loop it over the shorter


14
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.081
one. It's like giving your tie a friendly


15
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.321
hug. Don't worry if it feels like a


16
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.321
tangled mess. We're just getting started.


17
00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.242
We're going under the bridge, folks. Take


18
00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:53.962
that longer end and wrap it around the


19
00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:56.602
loop you just made. Think of it as a


20
00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.042
scene detour under a tiny, tiny bridge.


21
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.522
And if you see a troll, just pay the toll


22
00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:02.722
in fashion sense.


23
00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.562
Now let's venture through that cave.


24
00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:10.282
Gently slide the long end through the


25
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:12.642
loop around your neck. This is the part


26
00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:14.282
where it magically starts to look like a


27
00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.602
tie, and not like you're trying to lasso


28
00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:19.443
a wild unicorn.


29
00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:22.203
Lastly, for the final showdown, tighten that knot


30
00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:24.203
by pulling the long end. Adjust it to


31
00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:26.883
your liking. Not too tight, not too


32
00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:29.603
loose. Remember, comfort is key


33
00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.443
and you don't want to look like you're


34
00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:32.563
choking on style.
